# React-App-1 (Project)
This is my first individual react app using react components. This app will be entirely from scratch as will be used to show my capabilities as a web developer. 

## What I Will Use
In this project, I will use Nodejs, React, mySQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS as my basic coding lanuguages as well as a couple other various dependencies such as bcrypt.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to show not only that I am able to create visually appealing websites, but also to show that I am able to put functionality behind those websites in order to make a beautiful and highly functional website for any company I work for.

## About Me
Hello! My name is Noah Nelson and I am working towards being the best developer I can be by creating beautiful applications for people to use. I am a full stack developer and I have been certified by the University of Central Florida through their online coding bootcamp.

I am seeking a job as a react developer and am bolstering my portfolio to show what I can do individually as well as on a team.

I hope you enjoy. God bless!
